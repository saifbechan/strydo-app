# Strydo

A simple lightweight showcase Kanban board create in with React displaying some of the current latest features and libraries.

### Showcase

The application will be split into multiple version.

1. The first version will work with `React hooks`. There is a lot of prop drilling, and the setup might not be optimal.

2. The second version will be a little more advanced utilizing `React Redux`. Prop drilling will be way less, but we will still work with a offline data file.

3. Next Implement `Sagas` so we get a better seperation of concerns and prepare for async functions.

4. The fourth version will get the data from a server. This will be either `Google Firestore` or `AWS DynamoDB`.

5. The final version will have user authentication and a way to store your data on the server. This will be done by `Google Firebase`.

Maybe there will be more features and/or versions to the application. The main focus is showcasing.
